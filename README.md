# Python_Aptitude_Programming
In this repository, I wish to maintain programs written in Python programming language that will help build up logical thinking in undergraduate students in the discipline of computer science and engineering or those who are generally interested in programming. It may benefit students to look at pre-written code in order to kickstart their own programming journey.
